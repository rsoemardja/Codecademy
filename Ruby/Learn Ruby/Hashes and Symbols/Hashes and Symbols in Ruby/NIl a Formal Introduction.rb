#In Other Coding Languages you typically get an Error when it is not the right value
#In Ruby. Not so much you'll get the special value 'nil'.
# Along with false, nil is one of two non-true values in Ruby.

# But be aware that false and nil are NOT the same value.
# false means "not true" while nil is Ruby's way of "nothing at all".
