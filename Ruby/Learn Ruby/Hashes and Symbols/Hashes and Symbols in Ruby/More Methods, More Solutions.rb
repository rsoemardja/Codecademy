# Ruby includes .each_key and .each_value we can iterate More methods and more solutions.

# Sample Code
my_hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }

my_hash.each_key { |k| print k, " " }
# ==> one two three

my_hash.each_value { |v| print v, " " }
# ==> 1 2 3

# Solution Code
movie_ratings = {
  memento: 3,
  primer: 3.5,
  the_matrix: 3,
  truman_show: 4,
  red_dawn: 1.5,
  skyfall: 4,
  alex_cross: 2,
  uhf: 1,
  lion_king: 3.5
}
