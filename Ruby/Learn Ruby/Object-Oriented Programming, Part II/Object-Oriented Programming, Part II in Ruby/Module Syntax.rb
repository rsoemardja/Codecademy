# we will cover Module Syntax

# Sample Code
module ModuleName
	# Bits 'n pieces
end 

# Like class names, module name are written in CapitalizedCamelCase rather than lowercase_with_underscores

# Ruby constants are written in ALL_CAPS and are separated with underscores if there's more than one word

# An example of a Ruby constant is PI
# We created PI in our previous exercise,
# But don't worry: because they're separate modules

# My Solution
module MyLibrary
	FAVE_BOOK = 'My Favorite Book'
end
