# We will now cover the extend keyword in this exercise
# The extend keyword mixes a module's methods at the class level.
# This means that class itself can use the methods, as opposed to instances of the class

# Sample Solution of extend

# ThePresent has a .now method that we'll extend to TheHereAnd

module ThePresent
  def now
    puts "It's #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? Time.new.hour - 12 : Time.new.hour}:#{Time.new.min} #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'} (GMT)."
  end
end

class TheHereAnd
  extend ThePresent
end

TheHereAnd.now
